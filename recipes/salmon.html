<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Fish fillets can be a weeknight cook’s savior. They are healthful and 
    easy to prepare, require little time to cook and take well to all 
    manner of spices. In this straightforward recipe, adapted from the 
    New York chef Katy Sparks, you start with salmon fillets, liberally rub 
    them on one side with a mixture of ground coriander, cloves, cumin and 
    nutmeg, and then brown them in a very hot pan so the spices form a crust. 
    Flip once, and that’s it. For the best results, use fillets of equal 
    sizes, cook them to medium rare, and use freshly ground spices. If you 
    have only pre-ground, be sure they haven’t gone stale sitting in your 
    cabinet too long. (Yes, spices can go stale.)</p>

    <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat for 2 or 3 minutes. </li>

    <li>Cook about 2 to 3 minutes, or until the spice mixture forms a nicely browned crust.</li>
